This tutorial demonstrates how to analyze flow cytometry data using R.

## Part I: Compensation, Cleaning, and Transformation
- **Compensation**: Corrects spectral overlap between fluorochromes.
- **Cleaning**: QC checks to remove anomalies.
- **Transformation**: Applies Logicle transformations for better data Viz

## Part II: Manual Gating
- **Cell Gate**: Removes debris based on scatter properties (FSC-A vs. SSC-A).
- **Singlet Gate**: Excludes doublets using FSC-H vs. FSC-W.

## Part III: Auto Gating
- **Auto-Gating**: Uses `flowClust` for automated cell and singlet gating.
- **Quad Gating**: Further divides populations based on markers.
- **Statistics**: Computes quantiles and means for each gated population.
